Arduino Library for sending x10 messages by RF.

Created by Pieter Paul Baron (embedded [at] ppbaron.nl), November 2013.
Released into the public domain.

Library to send x10 messages via a cheap 433Mhz OOK device. No X10 Firecracker (CMA17A) necessary.
Decoding messages is not implemented.
This library can emulate x10 switches and security devices and also RFXMeter and RFXSensor devices manufactured by RFXCom. (www.rfxcom.com)

Tested on a TI Stellarpad (LM4F120H5QR), Energia 0101E0010 and Arduino. This should also work on other TI Launchpad devices.
